# WIP

This site/app is a work in progress.

# Getting Started

1. `cd` into `client` and run `npm install`
1. Then, run `gatsby develop`
1. From the root directory `cd` into `server` and run `npm install`
1. Then, run `npm run dev`. NOTE: you will need to have a MongoDB instance installed and configured in the file `./config/env/development`.

This should be enough to get you up and running. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at michauxkelley@gmail.com.
